The United States Department of Agriculture provides detailed information about participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. In addition to [bulk data](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-(snap)-data-system/time-series-data.aspx), they even provide [an API](http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer/geospatial-apis.aspx), with SNAP data endpoints, that has muncipal-level granularity. Note that this is aggregate data, not household-level data.

## Software and Standards

### Open Referral

"Open Referral is developing common standards and open platforms for the sharing of community resource directory data—i.e., information about the health, human and social services that are available to people in need." Their pilot projects are in Washington DC and San Francisco. [openreferral.org](https://www.openreferral.org/)
